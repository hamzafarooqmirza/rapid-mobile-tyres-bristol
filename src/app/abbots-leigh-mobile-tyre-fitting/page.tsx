                  The A369 is the key road through Abbots Leigh and one of the strongest local
                  features for this page. North Somerset Council records the A369 through the
                  village and specifically references A369 Abbots Leigh Road in local highway
                  notices. The Abbots Leigh Parish Council has also highlighted the level of
                  traffic using the A369 through the village.

                <p className="text-zinc-300">
                  For local drivers, it forms an important connection towards Leigh Woods and
                  Bristol in one direction and other North Somerset communities in the other. If
                  your tyre develops a problem around the A369, give us the exact road position or
                  nearest junction. Fitting can only take place where it is safe for both the
                  vehicle and technician.

                  If your vehicle is parked at a property around Church Road, mobile fitting can

                  official rights-of-way documentation. A tyre problem on one of these quieter

                  Beggar Bush Lane is also part of the local road network around Abbots Leigh and
                  Leigh Woods. North Somerset Council specifically references Beggar Bush Lane in
                  its Abbots Leigh rights-of-way information, while historic road notices also
                  record highway works there. This is particularly relevant for drivers travelling
                  between Abbots Leigh and the Bristol side of the area. If your tyre becomes
                  unusable around Beggar Bush Lane, send your exact position rather than relying
                  only on the road name.

                  For drivers making local journeys between villages, a puncture can be

                Abbots Leigh sits immediately west of Leigh Woods, with the A369 providing the
                principal road connection towards Bristol. North Somerset Council&apos;s current
                Leigh Woods parking area includes Abbots Leigh Road, Bridge Road, Church Road,
                North Road and Rownham Hill, showing how closely the two areas connect.
              </p>
              <p className="text-zinc-600">
                If you notice low pressure, sidewall damage or another tyre problem before
                starting a journey towards Bristol, dealing with it locally can be safer than
                hoping the tyre lasts until you reach the city. Our mobile tyre replacement in
                Abbots Leigh allows a suitable replacement to be fitted before you continue.

                Vehicles based in Abbots Leigh may be used for two very different types of
                driving. One journey might involve quieter local roads and village properties,
                while the next uses the A369 towards Bristol.
              </p>
              <p className="text-zinc-600">
                The correct tyre therefore needs to suit the vehicle itself rather than being
                selected simply because of the location. Depending on your tyre size and current
                stock, different replacement options may be available. Send the full tyre
                specification so suitable options can be checked.
