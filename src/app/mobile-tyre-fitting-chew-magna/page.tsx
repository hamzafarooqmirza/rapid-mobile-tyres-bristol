                The B3130 is one of the key roads through Chew Magna, running from the A37 through
                the village towards Winford. For local drivers, this route forms an important
                connection between the village and the surrounding road network. A puncture or
                damaged tyre around the B3130 can interrupt commuting, local journeys or travel
                towards neighbouring villages.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-300">
                Our mobile tyre service can attend suitable accessible locations around the B3130,
                subject to technician availability and safe working access. Bath & North East
                Somerset Council also identifies B3130 Winford Road, B3130 Chew Road and B3130
                Stanton Road in and around the village — roads that connect Chew Magna with nearby
                rural communities and the wider Chew Valley network.

              <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-300">
                Chew Magna&apos;s road layout includes High Street, Harford Square, Chew Hill and
                Silver Street within the village centre. If your vehicle is stopped somewhere
                within these village roads, giving the exact street and postcode is much more
                useful than simply saying &ldquo;Chew Magna&rdquo;. On narrower streets, fitting
                can only take place where the technician has enough room to work safely without
                creating an obstruction.

                When a vehicle is parked in a village or rural location, reaching a tyre centre
                with a damaged tyre may be inconvenient or unsafe. Mobile fitting removes that
                extra journey, allowing tyre replacement to be arranged at suitable homes,
                workplaces and roadside locations.

              necessarily need to take the vehicle to a tyre centre. Rapid Mobile Tyres can bring
              mobile tyre fitting in Chew Magna directly to your home, workplace or suitable
              roadside location. Contact us with your exact location, vehicle details and tyre
              size so we can check availability and arrange the appropriate mobile tyre callout.
